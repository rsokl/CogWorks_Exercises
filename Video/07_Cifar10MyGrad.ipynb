    "The tendril classification problem allowed us to use Neural Networks on a 2D toy dataset. In this notebook, we will work with an $n$-dimensional dataset of images, where $n$ is the total size (# pixels x # color-channels) of an image. We will be using the famed [cifar-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), so that our  model can classify pictures of cars, planes, cats, dogs, frogs, and other items. There are 10 classes in total represented in this dataset. Each image has is an 32 pixels by 32 pixels RGB image of shape ``(3,32,32)``. Thus each image is a point or vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{3072}$.\n",

Keep in mind that `mygrad`, and other auto-differentiation libraries, provide a convenient softmax_crossentropy function, which efficiently computes the softmax *and then* the corss-entropy. So take care to not invoke softmax twice, in  following the equations above."
