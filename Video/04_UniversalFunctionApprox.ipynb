    "- Once your loss curve (often called the \"learning curve\") plateaus, try reducing the learning rate and resume training. This will likely lower your loss further.\n",
    "- Once you have a good model, try plotting $f(x)$ and $F(x)$ *beyond* the domain that you trained it on. For example, try plotting them on $[-4\\pi, 4\\pi]$. What do you see? Is this reasonable? Discuss with a neighbor.\n",
    "  - Dig in a little deeper, plot each of the model's scaled neurons $v_{i}\\varphi(\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{w}_{i} + b_{i})$ on $[-4\\pi, 4\\pi]$. You should be able to visually see how the sigmoidal curves will sum outside of $[-2\\pi, 2\\pi]$\n",
    "- Try decreasing the the parameter-number in your model from $N=10$ down to $N=1$. Thus `w` will have the shape (1, 1) instead of (1, 10), etc. Train this model as best you can, and plot $F(x)$. What shape does this take? Can you explain why?\n",
    "- Using $N=10$, repeat your training but train on the domain $[2\\pi, 6\\pi]$. Are you able to get your model to train well? Why should shifting the domain have any affect if $f(x)$ is perfectly periodic. Consider what special properties our original domain, $[-2\\pi, 2\\pi]$ has. Consider, also, how we initialize our model's parameters. Discuss with your neighbor what you suspect might be the issue here. You can use `noggin` to plot the mean values of `w`, `v`, and `b` as you train. You can also plot the mean values of the gradients that are back-propagating through your model, with some minor modifications to your code. This is very interesting to visualize.\n",
    "- Fit a different $f(x)$ other than cosine. Do you need more parameters to approximate more complicated functions?\n",
    "- Try increasing $N$ to $N=1000$. You may need to try adjusting your learning rate during training, lowering it as you go. Does increasing $N$ make things better or worse in this instance?"
