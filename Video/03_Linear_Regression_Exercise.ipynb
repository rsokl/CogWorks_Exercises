    "Before, we found that we could exactly solve for the model parameters (i.e. the slope and y-intercept) that minimize the squared-residuals between our recorded data and our model's predictions. Now, we will act as if no such analytic solution exists, since this will almost always be the case in \"real world\" problems. Instead, we will use gradient descent to tune the parameters of our linear model, and we will do this by leveraging MyGrad's autodiff capabilities to compute the relevant gradients for this optimization process. The procedure that we exercise here will turn out to be almost exactly identical to the process for \"training a neural network\" using \"supervised learning\", which are concepts that we will dive into ."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise notebook provides the glue that connects the essential concepts that we have learned about thus far in our journey towards understanding machine learning using neural networks (i.e. deep learning).\n",
    "Namely, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defined a mathematical model designed to transform observed data into useful predictions.\n",
    "  - In this case the model was a simple linear model, but we could easily generalize it to more complicated mathematical forms.\n",
    "  - It was natural for us to represent our model in terms of a [Python class](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/module_4.html), since this allowed us to keep track of our model's parameters, our initialization scheme for the parameter values, and the code for performing a \"forward pass\" of our model on input data, all in one place.\n",
    "- Utilized automatic differentiation by using MyGrad's tensors and mathematical operations to store our model's parameters and to perform all of the mathematics associated with evaluating the model and the loss function for our problem. \n",
    "   - This gave us easy access to the gradient of the loss function with respect to our model's parameters. \n",
    "- Searched for optimal model parameter values - ones that minimize our loss function - by using gradient descent.\n",
    "   - We were introduced to the term \"epoch\" as an indicator that we had processed our dataset in its entirety.\n",
    "   - The selection of the learning rate was not informed by gradient descent or any obvious mathematics; we basically just made a guess at an appropriate value here (more on this later).\n",
    "   - This style of updating a mathematical model by using data containing the desired (or \"true\") predictions is known as \"supervised learning\".\n",
    "- Saw that the shape of our loss landscape had an impact on the efficacy of the gradient descent process, and, furthermore, that normalizing our data (to have a mean of $0$ and standard deviation of $1$) could help reshape this loss landscape to improve the model optimization process.\n",
    "   - This dynamic was rooted in the fact that the scales of the numbers associated with our raw data were such that making a small adjustment to $m$ made a much bigger impact on the quality of our model's predictions than did making a comparable adjustment to $b$.\n",
    "   - Normalizing our data helped to place $m$ and $b$ on more of an equal footing in terms of their influence on the model's predictions, and this led to healthier optimization performance, since we are using a single learning rate across all of the model's parameters.\n",
    "   - This parameter-scale balancing act will prove to be important for other, more sophisticated mathematical models as well, and data normalization will regularly be leveraged to help with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you revisit and revise this notebook regularly to keep the lessons learned here in hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we will never have the luxury of glimpsing the full loss landscape associated with our model and dataset as we did here.\n",
    "This is because our models will almost inevitable contain too many parameters to permit a plot of a 3D surface.\n",
    "So we wont have the benefit of qualitatively inspecting the trajectory of our gradient-based descent down the loss's surface, nor will we be able to easily glean the features of the surface's shape that prove difficult to traverse.\n",
    "For this reason, it is important to thoroughly internalize the lessons learned from this simple problem and prepare ourselves to anticipate their manifestations in more complicated scenarios - where we will need to be much more savvy and clever to deal with them."
