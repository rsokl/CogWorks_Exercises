    "Autoencoders are a family of neural networks that can be leveraged to learn dense, abstract representations of data. These representations can often be used to make salient important, high-level features about our data. As an example of an encoder network, Facenets's facial-recognition model could take a picture of a face and **encode it** into a 512-dimensional vector that allowed us to tell the difference between individuals based on their personal appearances. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of an autoencoder as two separate neural nets: an encoder and a decoder. We pass in data to our encoder, which generates a useful, abstract representation for the data. This abstract representation of the data is then passed into the decoder, which will **try to recover the original data**. We train the encoder and decoder simultaneously, with the autoencoder learning to how to compress and uncompress the data in the most lossless way possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are a sort of hybrid supervised-unsupervised network. There *is* a truth value, but it is simply the original data (i.e., `ytrain = xtrain`). When the network is trained with `mean_squared_error` loss between the network's outputs and inputs, gradient descent will try to find parameters that result in good encodings (representations with reduced dimensionality) that allow the decoder to recover or reconstruct the original input.\n",
